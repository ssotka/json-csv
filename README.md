**JSON-CSV**

This repository is for a collection of scripts that convert between JSON and CSV.
Written in Raku as a small project to help me learn the language.

* bin/json2csv
* bin/csv2json
* bin/jsonStream2csv

The scripts depend on Text::CSV, JSON::Fast, and JSON::Stream. NOTE: Please feel free to contact me or suggest changes via the github project.
